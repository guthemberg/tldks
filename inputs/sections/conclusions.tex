\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, we presented WiseReplica, a SLA-based, adaptive replication scheme for meeting customers' expectations and enhancing resource allocation in peer-assisted VoD systems. To adapt replication, WiseReplica relies on a prediction model for ranking Internet videos in order of demand. Our intuitive model is flexible, and can learn from different sources and big amounts of data, providing a robust framework for controlling VoD resource allocation. Simulations using YouTube traces suggest that our ranking predictions of videos are important to enhance video delivery in peer-assisted VoD systems, allowing us to self-adapt replication degree to video demand properly. WiseReplica increases the average bitrate provision by roughly 85\%, contributing decisively to enhance viewing experience of users. Our future work will mainly cover a proof-of-concept prototype for evaluating WiseReplica in a real testbed.
